# Squale

This game was made by me between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of August 2024 for the [**GMTK Game Jam 2024**](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) on the theme *Built to Scale*.

This is my fourth game made using Pygame. I created all the code and visuals, while the sound effects and music are taken from the Internet (all credits can be found in the itch page below).

The rankings can be seen in the image below:
